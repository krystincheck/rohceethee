Edit 2: Organizing everything into Categories for easy reference.

I dropped in a new N3024P switch last night and its been giving me a bit of trouble with TFTP. Some info. An old 3524p (we'll call it Old Switch) was going out. So we replaced it with a new N3024P (New Switch). Before the replacement, we did a TFTP download of the Old Switch config. So we know the network is allowing that traffic between my laptop (the TFTP server) and the address/subnet of the switch in question. After dropping in the New Switch with the same basic config (including interfac. Description(Top/Haut de page). Tftpd64 is a free, opensource IPv6 ready application which includes DHCP, TFTP, DNS, SNTP and Syslog servers as well as a TFTP client. We use homegrown code to backup our network device configs (a mix of IOS and CatOS) using SNMP. Nearly everything has worked fine for a while but I have one switch running CatOS 8.3(2)GLX that takes a long time to finish the backup and drop the connection to our TFTP server. The config actually gets sent to the TFTP server but it takes a long time to finish, causing some post-processing to error out. If I manually back up the config using gt copy conf tftp there is no problem. However. Problem starting tftpd32/tftpd64 on inactive adapter (Windows) - posted in Tftpd32: Using latest version (v4.00) of tftpd32 and tftpd64 service edition, I have encountered the following problem running on various versions of Windows (XP and Windows 7 32-bit). Hey guys, I work at a school district that has an older Cisco 6509 running Cisco ios and we recently had some weird issues that got resolved, but my boss wants to set up a logging server specifically for that unit so that any issues with it can be troubleshooted more efficiently. I took a look at Greylog, Logstash and Kibana and it seemed a bit too overwhelming to set up correctly. I attempted to set it up but found the configuration of the dashboard and having it parse the Cisco 
I have installed Tftpd32 software in my windows 7 pc. I have running tftp server on my windows pc and tftp home directory has few directories and files. I have to display the tftp servers directori. Hey all. I would like to setup a deployment station to be able to install several OSs over the LAN. I am looking for software recommendations as the more I google and search the deeper into confusion I seem to fall. LANDesk? TFTPD32? I would like to install (and boot up if possible) the following OSs. Assume I have them all as OEM: Windows 7 (all versions) Windows XP (Pro amp Home Premium) Ubuntu 12.04 UBCD (this would be nice) For reference, I have a workstation with two NICs already TFTP Servers is a piece of software that every network admin and engineer will use one day or another, so we’ve come up with a list of the best free TFTP server software along with direct links to download Somehow several machines where I work were ordered without any DVD-ROM drives. These machines are at a remote site and I need to reinstall Windows on them to make them compliant. I am using TFTD32 ( for the first time. I get all the settings in there and the machines actually connect to the DHCP server, but it fails with being unable to find a PXE boot file. There's place to put the location of that, but I am not sure where to find one. The instructions I found. The 3rd party TFTPD32 software is very light, portable, fast, and configures very quickly. It is very flexible, as it can boot iso files and/or wim files. SYSLINUX is the boot loader I selected, because of how often it's updated. We currently run a full setup environment with 50+ deployment servers globally. We use MDT (2012 update 1 specifically), PXELinux, TFTPD32, DFS, Altiris, USMT and some robocopy to complete the whole solution. We have some custom scripts to complete the process as there are many entities and variations to even a "standard build." We transfer profiles, wireless settings (if windows vista or above) put custom software per device, etc. PXELinux we use a custom menu with WIMBoot, MEMDisk Is it possible to install Windows 7 (Current RTM Version) on a computer without using removable media like DVD or USB?The first thing that comes to my mind is through the network, but I don't have experience of doing a fresh install of Windows 7 via the network.

Hey gang, I'm trying to configure several H3C S3100 switches quickly via a TFTP server. I am using TFTPd32 on Windows 7.

Hi, I have this thomson modem that a friend gave me to test on my things but I can't configure it since I need the username and the password of the administrator not the user ones (username:user pass:user). I was originally trying to run an executable (tftpd32.exe) from Expect with the following command, but for some unknown reason it would hanged the entire script: exec c:/tftpd32.351/tftpd32.exe So, decided to call a batch file that will start the executable. I tried to call the batch file with the following command, but get an error message stating windows cannot find the file. exec c:/tftpd32.351/start_tftp.bat I also tried the following, but it does not start the executable: spwan. Tftpd32是一款专业高效的网络服务器包，包括DHCP服务器提供无限的自动或静态IP地址分配，同时提供TFTP客户端应用，支持tsize, blocksize 和 timeout等等。.
